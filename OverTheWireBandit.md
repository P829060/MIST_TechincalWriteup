# Over The Wire Levels 0 to 12

## My Experience 
I would like to say that it was really informative and doing it actually introduced me to various ciphers ( one level had ROT 13 and so when i searched for it, i found various other ciphers like caeser cipher, vigenere cipher etc. ). I do like to take part in future CTF's and feel the happiness of actually solving it. However, the 12 levels isn't enough to make it through a CTF (which is obvious). The only bad part is that you have to keep searching for documentation and its uses which isn't bad but some people on the internet with their half baked knowledge can mislead us into thinking some things are correct. The documentation that OTW provides is too long. I mean i get that we have to learn the documentation, but we can't remember all of them and it doesn't highlight what's important to know. In that case, Linux Luminarium does a great job of teaching us what's important and what's not. It's not that it's bad but i think they can be more specific on what to learn or what's important for us to know. Needless to say, i did enjoy a lot solving the levels. This feels much closer to a CTF exposure as it teaches basic linux commands, which can help in CTF challenges. Thanks a lot for providing us with these resourceful and helpful websites where we can increase our knowledge not only for CTF's but also basic cmd or cli commands :) .

# Level 0 T
his level is just a give away on the website. So yeah i dont need to say anything about this
